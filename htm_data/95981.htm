	<p>The median household income of $2,499 is  compared to the rest of the country. It is also  compared to nearby ZIP codes. While money isn't everything, ZIP code 95981 may not be as nice as other parts of town. </p><p>As with most parts of the country, vehicles are the most common form of transportation to places of employment. Pedestrians and cyclists beware. The area has some of lowest percentages of commutes without a vehicle in the country. Compared to other ZIP codes in the country, 95981 has very few people that work at home. In most parts of the country, the majority of commuters get to work in under half an hour. Most commuters in 95981 can expect to fall in that range. It is very uncommon, compared to the rest of the US, for employees to have to travel more than 45 minutes to their place of employment. </p>		<div class="well well-sm chart-section">
