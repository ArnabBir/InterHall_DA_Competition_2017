	<p>The median household income of $37,148 is  compared to the rest of the country. It is also  compared to nearby ZIP codes. So 96101 is likely to be one of the nicer parts of town with a more affluent demographic. </p><p>As with most parts of the country, vehicles are the most common form of transportation to places of employment. If you are a person that likes walking or biking to work, it will be a comfort for you to know that 96101 has a well above average number of people who do not use a vehicle to commute. In most parts of the country, the majority of commuters get to work in under half an hour. The commute in 96101 is that short for a higher percentage of workers than almost anywhere in the United States. Many commuters should consider themselves lucky that they don't have a longer commute. It is very uncommon, compared to the rest of the US, for employees to have to travel more than 45 minutes to their place of employment. </p>		<div class="well well-sm chart-section">
