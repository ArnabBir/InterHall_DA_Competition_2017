	<p>The median household income of $52,902 is  compared to the rest of the country. It is also  compared to nearby ZIP codes. So 95469 is likely to be one of the nicer parts of town with a more affluent demographic. </p><p>As with most parts of the country, vehicles are the most common form of transportation to places of employment. If you are a person that likes walking or biking to work, it will be a comfort for you to know that 95469 has a well above average number of people who do not use a vehicle to commute. In most parts of the country, the majority of commuters get to work in under half an hour. However, that is not the case in 95469. It has a much lower than average number of people that make it to work in under half an hour. Having to travel to work for over 45 minutes isn't uncommon for people who live here. </p>		<div class="well well-sm chart-section">
