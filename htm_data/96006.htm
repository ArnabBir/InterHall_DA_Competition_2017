	<p>The median household income of $57,321 is  compared to the rest of the country. It is also  compared to nearby ZIP codes. So 96006 is likely to be one of the nicer parts of town with a more affluent demographic. </p><p>As with most parts of the country, vehicles are the most common form of transportation to places of employment. In most parts of the country, the majority of commuters get to work in under half an hour. Most commuters in 96006 can expect to fall in that range. It is much more common for employees to have to travel over 45 minutes to their place of employment than most parts of country which could indicate bad traffic or that people typically live far from where they work. </p>		<div class="well well-sm chart-section">
