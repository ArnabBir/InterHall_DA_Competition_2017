	<p>The median household income of $50,917 is  compared to the rest of the country. It is also  compared to nearby ZIP codes. So 95936 is likely to be one of the nicer parts of town with a more affluent demographic. </p><p>As with most parts of the country, vehicles are the most common form of transportation to places of employment. If you are a person that likes walking or biking to work, it will be a comfort for you to know that 95936 has a well above average number of people who do not use a vehicle to commute. A higher percentage of people in 95936 than almost anywhere in the country avoid a commute altogether by working at home. In most parts of the country, the majority of commuters get to work in under half an hour. More commuters in 95936 get to experience these short commute times than most other ZIP codes. It is much more common for employees to have to travel over 45 minutes to their place of employment than most parts of country which could indicate bad traffic or that people typically live far from where they work. </p>		<div class="well well-sm chart-section">
