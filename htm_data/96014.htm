	<p>The median household income of $40,000 is  compared to the rest of the country. It is also  compared to nearby ZIP codes. So 96014 is likely to be one of the nicer parts of town with a more affluent demographic. </p><p>As with most parts of the country, vehicles are the most common form of transportation to places of employment. Pedestrians and cyclists beware. The area has some of lowest percentages of commutes without a vehicle in the country. Instead of a commute, a higher percentage of people in 96014 are able to work from home than most places in the nation. In most parts of the country, the majority of commuters get to work in under half an hour. However, that is not the case in 96014. It has a much lower than average number of people that make it to work in under half an hour. There are a slightly smaller percentage of employees that have to travel over 45 minutes to reach their place of employment. </p>		<div class="well well-sm chart-section">
