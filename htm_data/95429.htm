	<p>The median household income of $52,159 is  compared to the rest of the country. It is also  compared to nearby ZIP codes. So 95429 is likely to be one of the nicer parts of town with a more affluent demographic. </p><p>As with most parts of the country, vehicles are the most common form of transportation to places of employment. 95429 is extremely friendly to pedestrians/cyclists and the percentage of people using these transportation methods to commute to work are among the highest in the country. Compared to other ZIP codes in the country, 95429 has very few people that work at home. In most parts of the country, the majority of commuters get to work in under half an hour. In 95429 though, the percentage of people that make it to work in under half an hour is among the lowest. It is very uncommon, compared to the rest of the US, for employees to have to travel more than 45 minutes to their place of employment. </p>		<div class="well well-sm chart-section">
