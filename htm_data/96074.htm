While money isn't everything, ZIP code 96074 may not be as nice as other parts of town. </p><p>As with most parts of the country, vehicles are the most common form of transportation to places of employment. Pedestrians and cyclists beware. The area has some of lowest percentages of commutes without a vehicle in the country. Compared to other ZIP codes in the country, 96074 has very few people that work at home. In most parts of the country, the majority of commuters get to work in under half an hour. A slightly higher than average number of commuters in 96074 can expect to fall in that range. It is very uncommon, compared to the rest of the US, for employees to have to travel more than 45 minutes to their place of employment. </p>		<div class="well well-sm chart-section">
