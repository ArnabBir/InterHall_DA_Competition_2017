	<p>The median household income of $62,976 is  compared to the rest of the country. It is also  compared to nearby ZIP codes. So 95631 is likely to be one of the nicer parts of town with a more affluent demographic. </p><p>As with most parts of the country, vehicles are the most common form of transportation to places of employment. Instead of a commute, a higher percentage of people in 95631 are able to work from home than most places in the nation. In most parts of the country, the majority of commuters get to work in under half an hour. In 95631 though, the percentage of people that make it to work in under half an hour is among the lowest. The area has an extremely high percentage of people that most travel over 45 minutes to their place of employment. People that commute should be aware of the potentially long commute times. </p>		<div class="well well-sm chart-section">
